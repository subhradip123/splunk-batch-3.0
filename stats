stats:
used for statictical aggrigations like, min, max,mean,avg,sum,distinct count.

... | stats <stat-func>(<field_name>) as "new_field_name" by <field_name>

count:
return total incoming events.

eg.
index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd_ui_access | stats count(status) as count_of_status by method

* you can use multiple splilt by fields.
eg.
index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd_ui_access | stats count(status) as count_of_status by method,file

min:
return the minimum value of a field.

eg.
index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd_ui_access | stats min(bytes) as lowest_bytes by method

max:
returns the maximum value of a field.

eg.
index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd_ui_access | stats max(bytes) as highest_bytes by method

avg:
eg.
index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd_ui_access | stats max(bytes) as highest_bytes min(bytes) as lowest_bytes avg(bytes) as average_bytes by method

sum:
returns summation of field values.

eg.
index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd_ui_access | stats sum(bytes) as total_bytes by method

list:
returns list of all field values.

eg.
index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd_ui_access | stats list(status) by method


values:
returns list of unique values of a field.

eg.
index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd_ui_access | stats values(status) by method


diff between count and distinct count:
index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd_ui_access | stats count(status) list(status) dc(status) values(status) by method

ex.
get min,max,avg,sum,unique values of status respect to files [run in 7 days windows]
