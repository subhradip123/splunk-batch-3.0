timechart:
It will show statictical aggregation based on time.

all the functions we used in stats command can be used here.

... | timechart function(field_name) by <field_name>

* in timechart command multiple split by field cant be used.
* multiple func can be used with timechart

eg.
index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd_ui_access | timechart span=5h count(bytes) as bytes_count max(bytes) as max_bytes min(bytes) as min_bytes avg(bytes) as avg_bytes


interval:
If run for last 24 hours windows, interval would be 30 mins.
If run for last 60 min windows, interval would be 1 min.
If run for last 15 mins windows, interval would be 10 secs.

custom interval:
span is an attribute used for custom interval.

s --> secs
m -->minutes
h -->hours
d -->day
w --> week
mon --> month

* by default timechart command return 10 split by field values.

We can change that value by using limit attribute.
eg.
index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd_ui_access | timechart limit=15 count by file

task: what is others and null in timechart command?

omit null and other :
usenull=f used to omit null
useother=f used to omit other.
eg.
index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd_ui_access | timechart limit=15 count by file usenull=f useother=f


fillnull:
fill all the blank values with zero.
eg.
index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd_ui_access | timechart span=5h max(bytes) as max_bytes min(bytes) as min_bytes | fillnull

... | fillnull value="..."
eg.
index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd_ui_access | timechart span=5h max(bytes) as max_bytes min(bytes) as min_bytes | fillnull value="null"
